# Coffee-PowerBI-

This repository contains an analysis of a coffee dataset. The analysis mostly goes over the various aspects of the profile of different coffee beans. Every aspect including the overall profile is based on a 0-10 scale. The analysis also includes how many bags of coffee beans are made per year per color of bean. There is a pie charts describing which kind of defect is most prevalent in the coffee. 

Types of defects:
- Category 1: Full black or sour bean, pod/cherry, and large or medium sticks or stones.
- Category 2: Parchment, hull/husk, broken/chipped, insect damage, partial black or sour, shell, small sticks or stones, water damage.

The original PowerBI file is in pbix format, while a PNG of the PowerBI file is also available. The PNG file lacks the abilities of pbix file, but doesn't need to be downloaded like the pbix format.
